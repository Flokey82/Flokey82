### Hi there :P Get comfy and stay a while!

My passion is procedural generation, simulation, and generative history but be warned, I'm not an expert as I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm doing my best :)

Slowly but steady, I'm building a (Golang) repository of example implementations, ports, helper libraries, and demos of various procgen techniques, (game) AIs, simulations, and game components, in the pursuit of generating entire worlds and civilizations, down to individual fates, legends, and heroes.

I hope you find something interesting that might help you in your own endeavors.

Cheers, Flo
